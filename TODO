Some things that are to be done on the sound-system (in no particular order):

 ! All #include directives (which included stuff from lib/sound) are now removed from src/ code and replaced with lib/sound/sound.h.
  ! Design issue: lib/sound/sound.h should (at all times) provide the full interface to the library. Wether the using code is C or C++ it should not depend on any other include file than this one.
   * TODO: create a list of all sound related functions used by the codebase, then list the purpose of the function (i.e. what it does, not how it does that)

 * Probably two sound rendering contexts needed, one for ingame and one for the GUI (outside of the game)

 * Provide some abstracted method for the managment of the `OpenAL Listener` object (e.g. a class)
  * Needs to be regularly updated for distance attenuation
  * Doppler effect implementation through Listener velocity as well maybe? (would require that "scrolling around" the map is passed through to the sound lib)
  * Provide conversion functions for listener orientation (uses two vectors rather than just a rotation angle) and position (can probably be implemented by simply copying the current OpenGL x,y,z coords from the "camera")

 * Enable sounddevice enumeration

Some things that are to be done on the sound-system (in no particular order):

 * Remove all #include directives (which now include stuff from lib/sound) from the general src/ code and replace them with one header file.

 * Probably two sound rendering contexts needed, one for ingame and one for the GUI (outside of the game)

 * Provide some abstracted method for the managment of the `OpenAL Listener` object (e.g. a class)
  * Needs to be regularly updated for distance attenuation
  * Doppler effect implementation through Listener velocity as well maybe? (would require that "scrolling around" the map is passed through to the sound lib)
  * Provide conversion functions for listener orientation (uses two vectors rather than just a rotation angle) and position (can probably be implemented by simply copying the current OpenGL x,y,z coords from the "camera")

 * Enable sounddevice enumeration
